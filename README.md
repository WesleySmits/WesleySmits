## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wesley, I am a Senior Front-end Developer with a hidden side-love for digital marketing.

My web journey began all the way back in 2006 when I was 13-years old and started a small gig doing SEO work for websites. Iâ€™d optimise the metadata, the texts, and do some link building. This got me interested in websites and by 2007 I was building my own websites and experimenting with Affiliate Marketing and Google Adsense.

Fast-forward to 2014 where I started my first job for an employer as a Front-end Developer at Divide. Here I spend a little under 5-years building E-commerce sites for Fashion Retail brands and thinking of ways to make their websites more user-friendly, rank higher and have better conversion rates. After working on dozens and dozens of projects, I wanted a chance of dedicating myself to a single project, and I started working at Nature.House in the summer of 2019 as a Senior Front-end Web Developer. I work with a remarkable team of people making the application a bit better every single day.
